### 1. **Character Counter**  
   - **Description**: Counts vowels, consonants, spaces, and other characters in an input string.  
   - **Usage**: Run the script, input a string, and view the results.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```plaintext
     Enter a string: Hello World! 123
     Vowels: 3  
     Consonants: 7  
     Spaces: 2  
     Other characters: 3
     ```

### 2. **Digit Sum Calculator**  
   - **Description**: Calculates the sum of digits in an input string.  
   - **Usage**: Run the script and input a string containing digits.  
   - **Example**:  
     ```plaintext
     Enter a string: Python3.10 is fun!
     Sum of digits: 4 (3 + 1 + 0)
     ```

### 3. **Pattern Generator**  
   - **3a. Right-Aligned Pyramid**  
     - **Description**: Generates a right-aligned number pyramid using nested `for` loops.  
     - **Output**:  
       ```plaintext
           1
          12
         123
        1234
       12345
       ```
   - **3b. Left-Aligned Staircase**  
     - **Description**: Generates a left-aligned staircase pattern using nested `while` loops.  
     - **Output**:  
       ```plaintext
       1
       333
       55555
       666666
       7777777
       ```

# Activity 1: Condition 
---

## Features

- **Part 1**: Finds the highest number using nested conditional statements.  
- **Part 2**: Sorts the three numbers in descending order using logical comparisons (no built-in sorting functions).  

---

## Example Output

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3
Enter third number: 7

The highest number is 10.0

Numbers in descending order: 10.0 7.0 3.0
```
---
# Activity 2: Looping
---

## Programs

### 1. Sum of Numbers from First Term to Last Term
This program calculates the sum of numbers from a starting term to an ending term provided by the user.

**Example Output:**
```
Enter first term number: 10
Enter last term number: 15
The sum of the numbers from 10 to 15 is 75
```

---

### 2. Prime Number Checker
This program checks if a given number is a prime number using a loop.
**Example Output:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is a prime number.
```


## Overview
This repository contains solutions for the IT0011 (Integrative Programming and Technologies) technical midterm examination. The assignment focuses on two main programming challenges:
1. Palindrome Sum Checker
2. Date Format Converter

## Problem Descriptions

### 1. Palindrome Sum Checker
This program reads numbers from a file and determines if their sum forms a palindrome.

#### Requirements
- Input: File named `numbers.txt` containing comma-separated numbers on each line
- Output: For each line, indicate whether the sum is a palindrome

### 2. Date Format Converter
This program converts dates from MM/DD/YYYY format to a more readable format.

#### Requirements
- Input: Date string in MM/DD/YYYY format
- Output: Date in "Month Day, Year" format
